## Welcome to my portfolio webpage !

We were assigned with the task of creating a portfolio landing page which displays the following criteria:

1. **When loading the page the viewer is presented with the dev's name, photo/avatar, and a navbar with links that jump to the specified section**

2. **When clicking on a link from the portfolio section, then the viewer is presented with a new tab that opens to the specified repo/page**

3. **When viewing the page, the viewer can adjust the screen size/resolution and the webpage responds with its responsive layout**
